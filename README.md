# Introduction

|        The goal of any team, regardless of which sport the team plays, is to win the National Championship. In doing so, the team earns the right to claim that they are the number one team at that particular level. In men's college basketball, that means winning the March Madness Tournament. To get into the tournament a team must either win a division one conference (there are 32 division one conferences) or be selected by the NCAA Men's Division 1 Basketball Committee (36 teams or chosesn). In all, there are 68 teams that are in the tournament. Four teams are eliminated in the "play-in" round, leaving 64 teams split into four regions. In each region there are 16 teams that are given seeds 1 through 16. The tournament is single elimination and once each region has a winner, those winners play against each other until only one team remains. The tournament is a daunting task for any team. Once the tournament begins, anything can happen. In 1982, the term March Madness was coined to the tournament due to the major upsets and nail biting games. Now days, it is well known how chaotic the tournament is and in fact, it has turned into a challenge to try and predict the winner of every game. However, this is not an easy task since the odds of predicting all the games is roughly 1 in 9 quintillion! All across the United States, people implement different strategies in picking the winners. Some take a statistical approach, while others go off of gut feelings. Some individuals even go by mascots and/or team colors! All methods experience varying success. However, with improved technology and the understanding of data and how to use it, it may be possible to make better decisions when picking the winners in the March Madness Tournament.
